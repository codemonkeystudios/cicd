# CI/CD Pipelines for Small Business 🚀🐒

Welcome to the jungle of pipelines, friends!  
This repo powers the **Adobe ColdFusion Summit 2025** session:  
**“Stop developing on production! CI/CD pipelines for small business that are fast, effective, and inexpensive.”**

## 📂 What’s Inside (a.k.a. The Good Stuff)
- **docker_environments/** – Spin up your own ColdFusion playground faster than you can say `docker-compose up`.
- **env_samples/** – Example `.env` files with more comments than your Facebook uncle’s political posts.
- **pipelines/** – Ready-to-steal CI/CD YAMLs for GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, AWS, GCP, and Azure. Copy → Paste → Profit.
- **CF Summit Checklist.pdf** – Soup-to-nuts setup guide (hold the nuts, unless you like them).
- **CI-CD Cost Cheat Sheet.pdf** – Because “free” is a lie and AWS bills are scarier than horror movies.
- **CI-CD Vocabulary Cheat Sheet.pdf** – Impress your boss by knowing the difference between “artifact” and “artifacting.”
- **Common Pitfalls.pdf** – Learn from others’ mistakes, laugh at them, then avoid making them yourself.
- **Glossary for Managers.pdf** – The Rosetta Stone for explaining DevOps to non-technical humans.
- **Rollback and Recovery Recipes.pdf** – For when you break prod (don’t worry, we’ve all been there).
- **Security Gotchas Checklist.pdf** – The “don’t get hacked” starter pack.
- **Keynote.pdf / Presentation.key** – Slides from the big show. Spoilers: they’re awesome.

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists
Because small shops deserve big pipelines without the big price tag.  
You’ll learn how to:
- Stop cowboy-coding directly on production (yes, YOU).
- Set up real CI/CD pipelines without selling a kidney to pay for infrastructure.
- Deploy ColdFusion apps (and more) like a boss.

## 🛠 You’ll Need
- Docker & Docker Compose 🐳
- A GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket account (don’t worry, we support your bad choices equally).
- A cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure). Choose your fighter.
